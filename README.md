What is a container ?
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

Ok, let me make it easy !!!

A container is a bundle of Application, Application libraries required to run your application and the minimum system dependencies.



**Containers vs Virtual Machine**
Containers and virtual machines are both technologies used to isolate applications and their dependencies, but they have some key differences:

1. Resource Utilization: Containers share the host operating system kernel, making them lighter and faster than VMs. VMs have a full-fledged OS and hypervisor, making them more resource-intensive.

2. Portability: Containers are designed to be portable and can run on any system with a compatible host operating system. VMs are less portable as they need a compatible hypervisor to run.

3. Security: VMs provide a higher level of security as each VM has its own operating system and can be isolated from the host and other VMs. Containers provide less isolation, as they share the host operating system.
Management: Managing containers is typically easier than managing VMs, as containers are designed to be lightweight and fast-moving.
Why are containers light weight ?
Containers are lightweight because they use a technology called containerization, which allows them to share the host operating system's kernel and libraries, while still providing isolation for the application and its dependencies. This results in a smaller footprint compared to traditional virtual machines, as the containers do not need to include a full operating system. Additionally, Docker containers are designed to be minimal, only including what is necessary for the application to run, further reducing their size.




**Docker**
What is Docker ?
Docker is a containerization platform that provides easy way to containerize your applications, which means, using Docker you can build container images, run the images to create containers and also push these containers to container regestries such as DockerHub, Quay.io and so on.

In simple words, you can understand as containerization is a concept or technology and Docker Implements Containerization


**Docker LifeCycle**
We can use the above Image as reference to understand the lifecycle of Docker.

There are three important things,

docker build -> builds docker images from Dockerfile
docker run -> runs container from docker images
docker push -> push the container image to public/private regestries to share the docker images.


**Docker daemon**
The Docker daemon (dockerd) listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. A daemon can also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker services.

Docker client
The Docker client (docker) is the primary way that many Docker users interact with Docker. When you use commands such as docker run, the client sends these commands to dockerd, which carries them out. The docker command uses the Docker API. The Docker client can communicate with more than one daemon.

**Docker Desktop**
Docker Desktop is an easy-to-install application for your Mac, Windows or Linux environment that enables you to build and share containerized applications and microservices. Docker Desktop includes the Docker daemon (dockerd), the Docker client (docker), Docker Compose, Docker Content Trust, Kubernetes, and Credential Helper. For more information, see Docker Desktop.

**Docker registries**
A Docker registry stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use, and Docker is configured to look for images on Docker Hub by default. You can even run your own private registry.

When you use the docker pull or docker run commands, the required images are pulled from your configured registry. When you use the docker push command, your image is pushed to your configured registry. Docker objects

When you use Docker, you are creating and using images, containers, networks, volumes, plugins, and other objects. This section is a brief overview of some of those objects.

**Dockerfile**
Dockerfile is a file where you provide the steps to build your Docker Image.

**Images**
An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. Often, an image is based on another image, with some additional customization. For example, you may build an image which is based on the ubuntu image, but installs the Apache web server and your application, as well as the configuration details needed to make your application run.

You might create your own images or you might only use those created by others and published in a registry. To build your own image, you create a Dockerfile with a simple syntax for defining the steps needed to create the image and run it. Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a layer in the image. When you change the Dockerfile and rebuild the image, only those layers which have changed are rebuilt. This is part of what makes images so lightweight, small, and fast, when compared to other virtualization technologies.

**STEPS TO RUN DOCKER**

A very detailed instructions to install Docker are provide in the below link

https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

For Demo,

**You can create an Ubuntu EC2 Instance on AWS and run the below commands to install docker.**

sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io -y

**Start Docker and Grant Access**
A very common mistake that many beginners do is, After they install docker using the sudo access, they miss the step to Start the Docker daemon and grant acess to the user they want to use to interact with docker and run docker commands.

Always ensure the docker daemon is up and running.

A easy way to verify your Docker installation is by running the below command

docker run hello-world
If the output says:

docker: Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Post "http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.24/containers/create": dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied.
See 'docker run --help'.
This can mean two things,

Docker deamon is not running.
Your user does not have access to run docker commands.
Start Docker daemon
You use the below command to verify if the docker daemon is actually started and Active

sudo systemctl status docker
If you notice that the docker daemon is not running, you can start the daemon using the below command

sudo systemctl start docker
**Grant Access to your user to run docker commands**
To grant access to your user to run the docker command, you should add the user to the Docker Linux group. Docker group is create by default when docker is installed.

sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
In the above command ubuntu is the name of the user, you can change the username appropriately.

NOTE: : You need to logout and login back for the changes to be reflected.

**Docker is Installed, up and running** 🥳🥳
Use the same command again, to verify that docker is up and running.

docker run hello-world


**Clone this repository and move to example folder**
git clone https://github.com/iam-veeramalla/Docker-Zero-to-Hero
cd Docker-Zero-to-Hero

You must be feeling like a champ already



**STEPS TWO**
**TO RUN THE Docker Containerzation for Django**
**Clone this repository and move to example folder**
git clone https://github.com/iam-veeramalla/Docker-Zero-to-Hero
cd Docker-Zero-to-Hero
cd examples
cd python-web-apps

**Build your Docker Image**
You need to change the username accoringly in the below command
docker build -t tonymore/python-image:latest .
OR
sudo docker build .

**VIEW THE IMAGES**
sudo docker images

copy out the IMAGE ID be072ac5b644

**Run your  Docker Container**
sudo docker run -it tonymore/python-image
sudo docker run -p 8000:8000 -it tonymore/python-image
OR
sudo docker run -it be072ac5b644
sudo docker run -p 8000:8000 -it be072ac5b644

**TO VALIDATE LOCALLY** 
Copy your IP ADDRESS TOGETHER WITH THE PORT NUMBER YOU HAVE OPEN ON SECURITY GROUP ON YOUR CONSOLE
http://18.193.109.29:8000/demo/




**STEPS THREE **
** **Multi Stage Docker Builds | Reduce Image Size by 800 % | Distroless Container Images****
cd examples/
cd golang-multi-stage-docker-build/

INSTALL GOLAND ON YOUR CURRENT SERVER
sudo apt update
sudo apt install golang-go

go run calculator.go
DO SOME CALCULATION

nano dockerfile-without-multistage/Dockerfile 
cd golang-multi-stage-docker-build/
cd dockerfile-without-multistage/

**Build your Docker Image**
sudo docker build -t tonymore/simplecalculator-image:latest .
sudo docker images | head -5                    ( notice the size is higher)
cd ..
**RETURN TO** 
/Docker-Zero-to-Hero/examples/golang-multi-stage-docker-build$
ls
nano Dockerfile

**Build your Docker Image**
sudo docker build -t tonymore/simplecalculator-image:latest .
sudo docker images | head -5              (notices the sized has gone down)



**Fourth Class**
**Docker Mount and volume**
docker volume create tonymore
cd first-docker-file
docker build -t volumedemo
docker run -d --mount source=tonymore, target=/app nginx:latest
docker ps
docker inspect (add name of the container/ID)
MAKE SURE YOU DELETE THE CONTAINER BEFORE DELLETING THE VOLUME
docker volume rm tonymore



**Fifth Class**
Docker Network
How container can talk to the host
two ways 
container 1 >> talk to container 2
container 2 >> talk to container 1
the way conatiner can talk to your host is called **BRIDGE NETWORKING**(veth)

**Host-Networking**
the container directly used the network of the host

**Overlaying Networking**
**Docker zero** used to communicate with all the container in the host

STEPS
git clone https://github.com/iam-veeramalla/Docker-Zero-to-Hero
cd Docker-Zero-to-Hero
cd examples
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker.io
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl status docker
**ADD A CONTAINER** A
sudo docker run -d --name login nginx:latest
sudo docker exec -it login /bin/bash
sudo apt update
apt-get install iputils-ping -y
ping -V
sudo docker inspect login      ("IPAddress": "172.17.0.2",

**ADD A CONTAINER** B
Open new Terminal
git clone https://github.com/iam-veeramalla/Docker-Zero-to-Hero
cd Docker-Zero-to-Hero
cd examples
sudo docker run -d --name logout nginx:latest
sudo docker ps

sudo docker inspect logout     ("IPAddress": "172.17.0.3",
BOTH ARE IN THE SAME SUBNET

sudo docker exec -it login /bin/bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install iputils-ping -y
ping -V

**TO KNOW ALL NETWORK ON THIS HOST**
sudo docker network ls
sudo docker network create secure-network
sudo docker network ls
sudo docker run -d --name finance --network=secure-network nginx:latest
sudo docker ps
sudo docker inspect finance


**TO CONFIRM YOU CAN NOT REACHED FINANCE NETWORK**
RUN THE FINANCE IP ADDRESS IN ANY OF LOGIN/LOGOUT 
ping 172.18.0.2   (this is for finance) but ping from login, you notie no response


**Create a Container with the Host Network**
sudo docker run -d --name host-demo --network=host nginx:latest
sudo docker ps
sudo docker inspect host-demo
YOU NOTICE NO **IP ADDRESS** WAS GRANTED BECAUSE USING THE HOST **IP ADDRESS**
